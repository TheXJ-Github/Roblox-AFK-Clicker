# Roblox AFK Clicker
A simple program to prevent disconnecting when away from your computer playing Roblox

Although this also works for when you need to be away without wanting your computer to enter sleep mode


This is a project made for fun, not sure if I'll make any new releases

## Questions & Answers

Click 'Releases' toward the right, and download the .zip of the latest release

### Can you make this an actual auto-clicker?
I might release a separate repo exclusively for such, but not at this very instant

### Why is there no installer?
1. I have no clue how to make an installer in the first place
2. I'm lazy and don't want to waste more time than I should

### What programs did you use to create this?
1. Visual Studio 2019
